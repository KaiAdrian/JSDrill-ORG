            // Rather than having to pass i + 1 to your padRow call, you could instead start your loop at 1. This would allow you to create a one-indexed loop.

            // Update your iterator to start at 1 instead of 0.

            //KODA
            //  let i = 0; => let i=1...


            //   The pyramid looks a little funny now. Because you are starting the loop at 1 instead of 0, you do not need to add one to i when you pass it to padRow.

            // Update the first argument of your padRow call to be i.

            //KODA
            // rows.push(padRow(i, count));

    //             Unfortunately, now the bottom of the pyramid has disappeared.This is because you have created another off - by - one error.

    // Your original loop went for i values from 0 to 7, because count is 8 and your condition requires i to be less than count.Your loop is now running for i values from 1 to 7.

    // Your loop needs to be updated to run when i is 8, too.Looking at your logic, this means your loop should run when i is less than or equal to count.You can use the less than or equal to operator <= for this.

    // Update your loop condition to run while i is less than or equal to count.
