            To manipulate the result string, you will use a different type of loop. Specifically, a for...of loop, which iterates over each item in an iterable object and temporarily assigns it to a variable.

            Step 42
            Remember in your previous loop that you used the addition operator + to increase the value of i by 1.

            You can do a similar thing with a string value, by appending a new string to an existing string. For example, hello = hello + " World"; would add the string " World" to the existing string stored in the hello variable. This is called concatenation.

            In your for...of loop, use the addition operator to concatenate the row value to the result value.
